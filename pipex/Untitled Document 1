Fails: 

-> Makefile cmd cmd out : pipefd is still open in both of the children
-> executable with no permissions should print an adequate error
-> In case of SIGPIPE you dont close one of the fds probably from Infile (e.g. cat | ls)
-> Make sure that the last executed cmd or program returns the correct code
	(only for cmd) permission denied: 126 		cmd not found: 127 	failed open: 1
-> At no permission in outfile you get an invalid close

-> Big tip: Create for every command a child process AND DO BONUS!!!!!!!!!
-> 

BONUS: 

each cmd a child process

PARENT
-
-pipe and fork in a loop extract lastpid
---- cmd1 -> reads from infile redirects to pipe 1
-	|
-	|
-----cmd2 -> reads from pipe 1 redirects to pipe 2
-	|
-	|
-----cmd3 -> reads from pipe 2 redirects to outfile
-
-	wait to get exitcode from last PID
-	wait first for lastpid
	extract exit code 
-	wait for null
